# CustomChar - Your customized AI characters

![](/docs/banner.svg)

- **Repository:** [https://github.com/vietanhdev/CustomChar](https://github.com/vietanhdev/CustomChar).
- **Built With:** [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) (LLM, with [LLaMA-v2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)), [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) (speech recognition).

Your customized AI characters on commodity hardware. This project aims to be a framework to enable the creation of AI characters that can be used in games, simulations, virtual assistants, and other applications without depending on specific platforms, cloud services, or specialized hardware.

**Some of applications you can build with CustomChar:**

- Game characters that can talk to you and interact with you.
- Your customized virtual assistant. Think about a [JARVIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) version on your computer.
- Online education experience with virtual friends/teachers.
- Cloud services that enable users to create their own virtual characters.

**Note:** This project is still in the early stage of development. We are working hard to make it available as soon as possible. Star this project ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ to follow our progress and encourage us to make it happen.

## 4. Build

**CustomChar** depends on SDL2 library to capture audio from the microphone. Install SDL2 library before building.

```bash
# Install SDL2 on Linux
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

# Install SDL2 on Mac OS
brew install sdl2
```

Build the **CustomChar** executable:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## 5. Usage

Download the models before running the program:

```bash
bash scripts/download-models.sh
```

Run the program:

```bash
./customchar
```

## 6. Build documentation

- Step 1: Install **doxygen** first.

- Step 2: Build the documentation:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile.in
```

- Step 3: Deploy html documentation from `docs/_build/html`.

- Step 4: Our latest documentation is deployed at <https://docs.customchar.com>.

## 7. Contribution

We welcome all contributions to this project.

- For coding style, please follow the style of the existing code.
- We use a format tool for auto formatting the code. You can use the following command to format code before committing:

```bash
pre-commit install # Install pre-commit hook
bash scripts/format-code.sh # Format code (C++ styling)
```
