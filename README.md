## Build

**CustomChar** depends on SDL2 library to capture audio from the microphone. Install SDL2 library before building.

```bash
# Install SDL2 on Linux
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

# Install SDL2 on Mac OS
brew install sdl2
```

Build the **CustomChar** executable:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

Download the models before running the program:

```bash
bash scripts/download-models.sh
```

Run the program:

```bash
./customchar
```

## Build documentation

- Step 1: Install **doxygen** first.

- Step 2: Build the documentation:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile.in
```

- Step 3: Deploy html documentation from `docs/_build/html`.

- Step 4: Our lastest documentation is deployed at <https://docs.customchar.com>.
