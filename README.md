# CustomChar - Your customized AI characters

![](/docs/banner.svg)

- **Repository:** [https://github.com/vietanhdev/CustomChar](https://github.com/vietanhdev/CustomChar).
- **Built With:** [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) (LLM, with [LLaMA-v2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)), [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) (speech recognition).

Your customized AI characters - personal assistants on any hardware! This project aims to be a framework to enable the creation of AI characters that can be used in games, simulations, virtual assistants, and other applications without depending on specific platforms, cloud services, or specialized hardware.

**Some of the applications you can build with CustomChar:**

- Game characters that can talk to you and interact with you.
- Your customized virtual assistant. Think about a [JARVIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) version on your computer.
- Online education experience with virtual friends/teachers.
- Cloud services that enable users to create their own virtual characters.

**Our very early experiment with CustomChar**
